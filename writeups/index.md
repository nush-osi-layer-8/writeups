# Hey there!

We're OSI Layer 8. We began as a CTF team from NUS High School, with the core members Ambrose Chua, Daniel Lim and Chandrasekaran Akash. 

We participated in quite a number of CTFs, and won a few prizes. We organised training and a small CTF for NUS High School, and organised a miniCTF at GeekcampSG 2018+.

Over here, you'll find the writeups we wrote for some CTFs as well as links to some of our challenges we wrote.
