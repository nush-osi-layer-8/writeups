# Calling for Challenges!

Have a really neat idea for a CTF challenge? Drop us a direct message to Ambrose Chua (serverwentdown) via the [Geekcamp Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geekcampattendees/shared_invite/enQtNzM3MDc0ODM1MDYxLWEzODZjZjliMzFlMjhmNzMwZjUwYTc1NTUwZDY4NmQ1MmVmODI4NGNhMmVlODhjNTBiZWFiYzU4MGYxYzRmNjI). We'll be happy to implement your ideas. Not only do you get credit, you'll also get to solve it and gain points for yourself!

See you at Geekcamp 2019!
